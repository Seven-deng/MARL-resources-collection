# MARL resources collection
This is a collection of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Resources. The purpose of this repository is to give beginners a better understanding of MARL and accelerate the learning process. Some of the resources are written in Chinese.

I will continually update this repository and I welcome suggestions.(missing important papers, missing important resources, invalid links, etc.) It's only a first draft so far, I'll add more resources in the next few months.

This repository is not for commercial purposes.

## Open Source Environments
* StarCraft Micromanagement
   * [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) This is the original environment mentioned in the paper [The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04043). Note that pymarl is based on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac).
   * [link](https://github.com/starry-sky6688/StarCraft) This is a simplified implementation of [pymarl](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl)

* [MAgent](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/MAgent) Note that the original [project](https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent) is no longer maintained.
(I personally recommend the first two environments for beginners.)
